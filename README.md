# React Side Projects Collection

Welcome to my React Side Projects repository! 🚀

## 🎯 Motive

The primary motive of this repository is to serve as a growing collection of React side projects. It is designed to document my learning journey, showcase various implementations, and provide a centralized place for anyone to explore my work with React.

**What you will find here:**
- A variety of small to medium-sized React applications.
- Experiments with different libraries, hooks, and patterns.
- Progressive improvements in my coding style and technical skills.

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new projects.

### Current Projects:

#### 1. [React User List](./React%20User-List)
A small, responsive project that displays a list of user profiles in a grid layout.
- **Description**: This is the first project in the collection. It demonstrates a clean UI for displaying user data (name, role, skills, availability) using React components and Tailwind CSS.
- **Key Features**: Responsive design, card-based layout, and prop handling.
- **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
- **Location**: [`/React User-List`](./React%20User-List)

## 🔮 Future Plans

I plan to add more React side projects to this repository in the near future. These upcoming projects will cover:
- Form handling and validation.
- State management solutions (Redux, Context API, Zustand).
- REST API and GraphQL integrations.
- Custom hooks and reusable component libraries.
- Full-scale applications with routing and authentication.
